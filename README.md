# Transformer Canopy Cover

Calculates canopy cover (the percentage pixels identified as a plant) on a plot level for one or more images that have been processed by the [soilmask transformer](https://github.com/AgPipeline/transformer-soilmask) to mask the soil.

## Overview

This Transformer processes a soil mask image and generates a value of plot-level percent canopy cover. This is a scalar value representing the percent of the image mask that is classified as plant. 

The output is a csv file that can optionally be inserted into the BETYdb database.

## Algorithm description

The core idea of this transformer is to compute the percent of area that is identified as plant in a segmented image.
These masked images can be generated by the [soilmask transformer](https://github.com/AgPipeline/transformer-soilmask/blob/master/README.md) or similar algorithm.

This algorithm expects a one-layer geotiff file with the extention .tif or .tiff. See https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWRU0YgK3Y9aUy5TdRxj14gmjLlozGxo/view for an example. 

## Use 

### Sample Docker Command line

First build the Docker image, using the Dockerfile, and tag it agdrone/transformer-canopycover:1.1. 
Read about the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command if needed.

```bash
docker build -t agdrone/transformer-canopycover:1.1 ./
```

Below is a sample command line that shows how the canopy cover Docker image could be run.
An explanation of the command line options used follows.
Be sure to read up on the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command line for more information.

```bash
docker run --rm --mount "src=${PWD}/test_data,target=/mnt,type=bind" agdrone/transformer-canopycover:1.1 --working_space "/mnt" --metadata "/mnt/experiment.yaml" --citation_author "Me Myself" --citation_title "Something in the green" --citation_year "2019" --species "Big Plant" "/mnt/rgb_1_2_E.tif"
```

This example command line assumes the source files are located in the `test_data` folder off the current folder.
The name of the image to run is `agdrone/transformer-canopycover:1.1`.

We are using the same folder for the source metadata and the cleaned metadata.
By using multiple `--mount` options, the source and output files can be separated.

**Docker commands** \
Everything between 'docker' and the name of the image are docker commands.

- `run` indicates we want to run an image
- `--rm` automatically delete the image instance after it's run
- `--mount "src=${PWD}/test_data,target=/mnt,type=bind"` mounts the `${PWD}/test` folder to the `/mnt` folder of the running image

We mount the `${PWD}/test` folder to the running image to make available the file to the software in the image.

**Image's commands** \
The command line parameters after the image name are passed to the software inside the image.
Note that the paths provided are relative to the running image (see the --mount option specified above).

- `--working_space "/mnt"` specifies the folder to use as a workspace
- `--metadata "/mnt/experiment.yaml"` is the name of the source metadata to be cleaned
- `--citation_author "Me Myself"` the name of the author to cite in the resulting CSV file(s)
- `--citation_title "Something in the green"` the title of the citation to store in the resulting CSV file(s)
- `--citation_year "2019"` the year of the citation to store in the resulting CSV file(s)
- `"mnt/rgb_1_2_E.tif"` the names of one or more image files to use when calculating plot-level canopy cover

**Testing the Docker Transformer** \
In order to make sure that the canopy cover transformer is functioning correctly, create an image that is all black
using an image editor such as [gimp](https://www.gimp.org) and export the result to the working directory as a .tif or .tiff file.
Move this file to the project directory and then using the above docker run command, make sure that -1 is returned. Doing the same
with a completely white image, make sure that 0 is returned. 

The reason this should be done is in order to test the extremes for image data.

Next test on sample plot images and make sure that reasonable values are returned.
The following commands can be used to retrieve the plot images:
```bash
mkdir test_data
curl https://de.cyverse.org/dl/d/4108BB75-AAA3-48E1-BBD4-E10B06CADF54/sample_plot_images.zip -o test_data/sample_plot_images.zip
unzip test_data/sample_plot_images.zip -d test_data/
```

**Deploying the Transformer** \
Once you have used the transformer on your image data, you can upload your docker image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
so that it can be accessed remotely. Use a tutorial such as [this one](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html)
in order to upload your image to Docker Hub

## Acceptance Testing

There are automated test suites that are run via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
In this section we provide details on these tests so that they can be run locally as well.

These tests are run when a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [push](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) occurs on the `develop` or `master` branches.
There may be other instances when these tests are automatically run, but these are considered the mandatory events and branches.

### PyLint and PyTest

These tests are run against any Python scripts that are in the repository.

[PyLint](https://www.pylint.org/) is used to both check that Python code conforms to the recommended coding style, and checks for syntax errors.
The default behavior of PyLint is modified by the `pylint.rc` file in the [Organization-info](https://github.com/AgPipeline/Organization-info) repository.
Please also refer to our [Coding Standards](https://github.com/AgPipeline/Organization-info#python) for information on how we use [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).

The following command can be used to fetch the `pylint.rc` file:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgPipeline/Organization-info/master/pylint.rc
```

Assuming the `pylint.rc` file is in the current folder, the following command can be used against the `canopycover.py` file:
```bash
# Assumes Python3.7+ is default Python version
python -m pylint --rcfile ./pylint.rc canopycover.py
``` 

In the `tests` folder there are testing scripts and their supporting files.
The tests are designed to be run with [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
When running the tests, the root of the repository is expected to be the starting directory.

The command line for running the tests is as follows:
```bash
# Assumes Python3.7+ is default Python version
python -m pytest -rpP
```

If [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is installed, it can be used to generate a code coverage report as part of running PyTest.
The code coverage report shows how much of the code has been tested; it doesn't indicate **how well** that code has been tested.
The modified PyTest command line including coverage is:
```bash
# Assumes Python3.7+ is default Python version
python -m pytest --cov=. -rpP 
```

### Docker Testing

The Docker testing Workflow replicate the examples in this document to ensure they continue to work.
